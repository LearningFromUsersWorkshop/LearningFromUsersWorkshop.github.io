## 2019 Workshop Summary

**Date and Location:** October 20, 2019, 2:20-5:40pm PDT, in Room 3 at [IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org/year/2019/welcome)

The Machine Learning from User Interactions (MLUI) workshop seeks to bring together researchers to share their knowledge and build collaborations at the intersection of the Machine Learning and Visualization fields, with a focus on learning from user interaction.  Rather than focusing on what visualization can do to support machine learning (as in current Explainable AI research), this workshop seeks contributions on **how machine learning can support visualization**.  Such support incorporates human-centric sensemaking processes, user-driven analytical systems, and gaining insight from data.  Our intention in this workshop is to generate open discussion about how we currently learn from user interaction, how to build intelligent visualization systems, and how to proceed with future research in this area. We hope to foster discussion regarding systems, interaction models, and interaction techniques. Further, we hope to extend last year's collaborative creation of a research agenda that explores the future of machine learning with user interaction.

## WORKSHOP TOPICS

The topic of the workshop will focus on issues and opportunities related to the use of machine learning to learn from user interaction in the course of data visualization and analysis. Specifically, we will focus on research questions including:

- How are machine learning algorithms currently learning from user interaction, and what other possibilities exist?
- What kinds of interactions can provide feedback to machine learning algorithms?
- What can machine learning algorithms learn from interactions?
- Which machine learning algorithms are most applicable in this domain?
- How can machine learning algorithms be designed to enable user interaction and feedback?
- How can visualizations and interactions be designed to exploit machine learning algorithms?
- How can visualization system architectures be designed to support machine learning?
- How should we manage conflicts between the user's intent and the data or machine learning algorithm capabilities?
- How can we evaluate systems that incorporate both machine learning algorithms and user interaction together?
- How can machine learning and user interaction together make both computation and user cognition more efficient?
- How can we support the sensemaking process by learning from user interaction?

## SUBMISSIONS

We have two submission tracks: for papers and for posters.

### Papers

We invite research and position papers between 5 and 10 pages in length (NOT including references).  All submissions must be formatted according to the [VGTC conference style template](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) (i.e., NOT the journal style template that full papers use).  Papers are to be submitted online through the [Precision Conference System](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions/vis19r) **at the MLUI track**.  All papers accepted for presentation at the workshop will be published on IEEE Xplore and linked from the workshop website.  All papers should contain full author names and affiliations.  These papers are considered archival; reuse of the content in a follow-up publication is only permitted in a proper journal, and any extended version must extend the original paper by at least 30%.  If applicable, a link to a short video (up to 5 min. in length) may also be submitted. The papers will be juried by the organizers and selected external reviewers and will be chosen according to relevance, quality, and likelihood that they will stimulate and contribute to the discussion. At least one author of each accepted paper needs to register  for the conference (even if only for the workshop). Registration information will be available on the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome).
  
#### Important Dates

Submission deadline:  July 15, 2019 

Author notification:  August 13, 2019 

Camera-ready deadline:  August 22, 2019

Speaker Schedule Available:  September 15, 2019

Workshop:  October 20 or 21, 2019

### Posters

We invite both late-breaking work and contributions in this area from other research domains to submit extended abstracts between 2 and 4 pages in length (NOT including references).  All submissions must be formatted according to the [VGTC conference style template](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) (i.e., NOT the journal style template that full papers use).  Extended abstracts are to be submitted via email to our GMail account:  [learningfromusersworkshop@gmail.com](mailto:learningfromusersworkshop@gmail.com).  All abstracts accepted for presentation at the workshop will be linked from the workshop website.  All abstracts should contain full author names and affiliations.  If applicable, a link to a short video (up to 5 min. in length) may also be submitted. The abstracts will be juried by the organizers and selected external reviewers and will be chosen according to relevance, quality, and likelihood that they will stimulate and contribute to the discussion. At least one author of each accepted poster needs to register  for the conference (even if only for the workshop). Registration information will be available on the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome).
