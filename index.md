## 2021 Workshop Summary

**Date and Location:**  24 October 2021, 12:00-3:30pm CDT, Virtually held with IEEE VIS (24-29 October 2021)

The Machine Learning from User Interactions (MLUI) workshop seeks to bring together researchers to share their knowledge and build collaborations at the intersection of the Machine Learning and Visualization fields, with a focus on learning from user interaction.  Rather than focusing on what visualization can do to support machine learning (as in current Explainable AI research), this workshop seeks contributions on **how machine learning can support visualization**.  Such support incorporates human-centric sensemaking processes, user-driven analytical systems, and gaining insight from data.  Our intention in this workshop is to generate open discussion about how we currently learn from user interaction, how to build intelligent visualization systems, and how to proceed with future research in this area. We hope to foster discussion regarding systems, interaction models, and interaction techniques.  MLUI 2021 largely plans to continue the momentum in this research area that the previous workshops have initiated.

## WORKSHOP TOPICS

The topic of the workshop will focus on issues and opportunities related to the use of machine learning to learn from user interaction in the course of data visualization and analysis. Specifically, we will focus on research questions including:

- How are machine learning algorithms currently learning from user interaction, and what other possibilities exist?
- What kinds of interactions can provide feedback to machine learning algorithms?
- What can machine learning algorithms learn from interactions?
- Which machine learning algorithms are most applicable in this domain?
- How can machine learning algorithms be designed to enable user interaction and feedback?
- How can visualizations and interactions be designed to exploit machine learning algorithms?
- How can visualization system architectures be designed to support machine learning?
- How should we manage conflicts between the user's intent and the data or machine learning algorithm capabilities?
- How can we evaluate systems that incorporate both machine learning algorithms and user interaction together?
- How can machine learning and user interaction together make both computation and user cognition more efficient?
- How can we support the sensemaking process by learning from user interaction?


## SUBMISSIONS

This year, we plan to accept both short and long papers jointly in the same submission block.  Full papers have a length of 5-10 pages (not including references), while short papers are 2-4 pages (plus references).  Short papers are intended to capture either (1) limited aspects of a larger work that fit our call or (2) late-breaking work not yet mature enough for a full paper submission.  The option of submitting a short paper replaces the posters track that we previously offered at MLUI.  

Submissions should be uploaded to the [MLUI 2021 track on PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions), which can be found under VGTC->VIS2021.  All submissions will be reviewed by a committee of reviewers that we will organize.  This committee will include the workshop committee members. The size of the committee will be determined by the number of submissions, such that each submission is reviewed by at least 2 committee members.  Both full and short paper metadata (author information, title, university, etc.) as well as the submissions themselves will be posted to the workshop website in advance of the event.  Workshop papers will be archived on IEEE Xplore following the conference.
