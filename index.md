## 2021 Workshop Summary

**Date and Location:** TBD, held with IEEE VIS

The Machine Learning from User Interactions (MLUI) workshop seeks to bring together researchers to share their knowledge and build collaborations at the intersection of the Machine Learning and Visualization fields, with a focus on learning from user interaction.  Rather than focusing on what visualization can do to support machine learning (as in current Explainable AI research), this workshop seeks contributions on **how machine learning can support visualization**.  Such support incorporates human-centric sensemaking processes, user-driven analytical systems, and gaining insight from data.  Our intention in this workshop is to generate open discussion about how we currently learn from user interaction, how to build intelligent visualization systems, and how to proceed with future research in this area. We hope to foster discussion regarding systems, interaction models, and interaction techniques. Further, we hope to extend last year's collaborative creation of a research agenda that explores the future of machine learning with user interaction.


## WORKSHOP TOPICS

The topic of the workshop will focus on issues and opportunities related to the use of machine learning to learn from user interaction in the course of data visualization and analysis. Specifically, we will focus on research questions including:

- How are machine learning algorithms currently learning from user interaction, and what other possibilities exist?
- What kinds of interactions can provide feedback to machine learning algorithms?
- What can machine learning algorithms learn from interactions?
- Which machine learning algorithms are most applicable in this domain?
- How can machine learning algorithms be designed to enable user interaction and feedback?
- How can visualizations and interactions be designed to exploit machine learning algorithms?
- How can visualization system architectures be designed to support machine learning?
- How should we manage conflicts between the user's intent and the data or machine learning algorithm capabilities?
- How can we evaluate systems that incorporate both machine learning algorithms and user interaction together?
- How can machine learning and user interaction together make both computation and user cognition more efficient?
- How can we support the sensemaking process by learning from user interaction?


## SUBMISSIONS

We have two submission tracks, supporting both papers and late-breaking work.


### Papers

We invite research and position papers between 5 and 10 pages in length (NOT including references).  All submissions must be formatted according to the [VGTC conference style template](http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html) (i.e., NOT the journal style template that full papers use).  All papers accepted for presentation at the workshop will be published and linked from the workshop website.  All papers should contain full author names and affiliations.  These papers are considered archival; reuse of the content in a follow-up publication is only permitted in a proper journal, and any extended version must extend the original paper by at least 30%.  If applicable, a link to a short video (up to 5 min. in length) may also be submitted. The papers will be juried by the organizers and selected external reviewers and will be chosen according to relevance, quality, and likelihood that they will stimulate and contribute to the discussion. At least one author of each accepted paper needs to register  for the conference (even if only for the workshop).  Papers should be submitted to the "[VIS 2020 MLUI 2020](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions)" track in PCS under the VGTC Society.
  
  
#### Important Dates

Submission deadline:  July 24, 2020 

Author notification:  August 12, 2020

Camera-ready deadline:  August 21, 2020

Speaker Schedule Available:  October 1, 2020

Workshop:  October 25, 2020


### Late-Breaking Work

We anticipate that some participants would prefer to discuss either (1) limited aspects of their larger work that fit our call, or (2) late-breaking work.  This replaces the posters track that we previously offered at MLUI.  Submissions for this track will only require a ~250 word abstract, and selected talks will receive 5 minutes to present their current work.  Further submission details will follow.
